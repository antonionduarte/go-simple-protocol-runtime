// returns ErrShutdownTimeout if the WaitGroup that tracks every
// runtime goroutine has not drained within the supplied timeout.
//
// Use Shutdown from main when you want bounded shutdown latency
// (e.g. a SIGINT handler that should never block longer than the
// platform's grace period). Use Cancel when you don't care how long
// teardown takes; it blocks unconditionally.

// A non-positive timeout falls back to defaultShutdownTimeout. Once
// Shutdown is invoked, calling it again or calling Cancel is a
// no-op; the underlying ctx is already cancelled.
